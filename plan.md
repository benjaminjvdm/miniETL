# MiniETL Development Plan

## 1. Project Setup and Core Structure

*   Set up the basic Go project structure with a `main.go` file and a `go.mod` file for dependency management.
*   Define the core data structures for representing ETL configurations, data sources, transformations, and output destinations.
*   Implement basic command-line argument parsing using the `flag` package to handle input files, configuration files, and output destinations.

## 2. Configuration Management

*   Choose a configuration format (YAML or JSON) and implement the logic to read and parse the configuration file.
*   Define the structure of the configuration file, including sections for input sources, transformations, and output destinations.
*   Implement validation logic to ensure the configuration file is valid and contains all required information.

## 3. Data Source Handling

*   Implement support for reading CSV and JSON files.
*   For CSV files, handle different delimiters, encodings (UTF-8), and header rows.
*   For JSON files, handle various structures and data types.
*   Create interfaces for data sources to allow for easy addition of new data source types.

## 4. Transformation Pipeline

*   Define a set of built-in transformations, such as field renaming, data type conversion, filtering, and aggregation.
*   Implement a flexible transformation pipeline that allows users to chain multiple transformations together.
*   Explore options for allowing users to define custom transformations, such as using a scripting language (Lua) or a configuration file.
*   Create interfaces for transformations to allow for easy addition of new transformation types.

## 5. Output Destination Handling

*   Implement support for writing transformed data to CSV and JSON files.
*   Explore options for supporting writing data to databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   Create interfaces for output destinations to allow for easy addition of new output destination types.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

*   Implement robust error handling throughout the application, providing informative error messages.
*   Integrate a logging framework (e.g., `log`, `logrus`) to track application activity and facilitate debugging.
*   Log errors, warnings, and informational messages.

## 7. Concurrency

*   Design the application to leverage Go's concurrency features for improved performance, particularly when processing large files.
*   Use goroutines and channels to process data concurrently.

## 8. Testing

*   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the application's reliability and correctness.
*   Use the `testing` package to write tests.

## 9. CLI Interface

*   Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the application, specifying input files, configuration files, and output destinations.
*   Use the `flag` package to handle command-line arguments.

## 10. Extensibility

*   Design the application with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new data sources, transformations, and output formats.
*   Use interfaces and plugins to achieve this.
